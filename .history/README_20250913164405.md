 README section that guides through setup with uv, virtual environments, Git config, and running Streamlit, with Windows/macOS/Linux activation notes.

## Quick start
- Ensure **Python** is available by running `python --version`; if it prints a version, Python is installed and usable with uv workflows that can manage interpreters as needed.[1][2]
- Check **uv** by running `uv --version`; if it shows a version, uv is installed and ready.[3][2]
- If `uv` isn’t found, install uv using the official installer script or platform method, then re-run `uv --version` to verify.[4][3]

## Verify uv in PATH
- In Python, uv’s location can be checked via:
  - `python -c "import shutil, sys; print(shutil.which('uv') or 'uv not found')"` to confirm the executable path or absence in PATH.[2][3]

## Initialize a project
- Create a new uv-managed project structure:
  - `uv init <my-project-name>` to scaffold a project with pyproject and lock files managed by uv.[2][4]
- Change into the project directory before proceeding with environment and dependency steps.[4][2]

## Manage packages
- List installed packages in the active environment with `uv pip list` for a pip-compatible listing within uv’s environment context.[5][2]
- Add a package to the project and sync environment with `uv add <package_name>`; this updates pyproject and uv.lock and installs it.[2][4]
- Install from a requirements file using `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` if working from legacy requirements.[5][2]
- Alternatively, sync all dependencies specified in pyproject/lock with `uv sync` when adopting uv’s workflow fully.[4][2]

## Manage Python versions
- Show available Python interpreters known/installed via `uv python list` to inspect versions uv can use or install.[1][2]
- Create a virtual environment with a specific interpreter:
  - `uv venv <your-env-name> --python cpython-3.10.18-windows-x86_64-none` for an explicit build tag on Windows, or simply `uv venv <your-env-name> --python 3.10`.[1][5]
- Recommended Python versions: **3.10**, **3.11**, or **3.12** for broad package compatibility and current support windows.[1][2]

## Activate the virtual environment
- Windows Command Prompt (CMD):
  - `.<your-env-name>\Scripts\activate.bat` to activate the environment in CMD.[6][5]
- Windows PowerShell:
  - `.<your-env-name>\Scripts\Activate.ps1` and, if needed, set execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` (run as admin for broader scope).[6][5]
- Git Bash / WSL / macOS or Linux shells:
  - `source <your-env-name>/bin/activate` for POSIX shells; for Git Bash on Windows when using a Windows-style venv, `source <your-env-name>/Scripts/activate` can work depending on shell settings.[7][5]
- Tip: uv can also run commands within the environment without manual activation using `uv run <command>`, which auto-selects the project venv when present.[7][4]

## Git configuration (if prompted on push)
- Configure global identity once for publishing to a remote:
  - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` to set a display name used in commits.[2][4]
  - `git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"` to set commit email; ensure it matches hosting provider settings when required.[4][2]

## Install from requirements
- For projects with an existing requirements file:
  - `uv add -r requirements.txt` to translate and sync dependencies into pyproject/lock, or use `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` to install into the current venv without adopting pyproject yet.[5][4]

## Run Streamlit app
- Start a Streamlit app:
  - `streamlit run <your_app.py>` to launch a local server and open the app in the browser.[8][9]
- Pass script arguments after two dashes, for example: `streamlit run <your_app.py> -- --flag value` so Streamlit doesn’t interpret them as its own options.[9][8]
- Streamlit can also be launched as a Python module: `python -m streamlit run <your_app.py>`, equivalent to the CLI form.[8][9]

## VS Code tip
- For static HTML testing, install the “Live Server” extension in VS Code to serve HTML with auto-reload during development.[2][4]

## Common command reference
- Check uv version: `uv --version` to confirm installation and path setup.[3][2]
- List packages: `uv pip list` for the current environment’s installed distributions.[5][2]
- List Python interpreters: `uv python list` to review versions uv can use or install.[1][2]
- Create venv:
  - Generic: `uv venv <env-name> --python 3.11` to target a specific Python minor version.[5][1]
  - Windows tag example: `uv venv env --python cpython-3.10.18-windows-x86_64-none` to pin an exact build.[1][2]
- Activate venv:
  - CMD: `.<env>\Scripts\activate.bat` for Windows command prompt.[6][5]
  - Git Bash/WSL/macOS/Linux: `source <env>/bin/activate` for POSIX activation; Git Bash with Windows-style venv may use `source <env>/Scripts/activate`.[7][5]
- Add a package: `uv add <package_name>` to record and install into the project environment.[4][2]
- Install from requirements: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` for legacy workflows, or `uv add -r requirements.txt` to migrate into uv’s project management.[5][4]
- Run Streamlit: `streamlit run <your_app.py>` to launch the app server locally.[10][8]

Notes:
- If Python isn’t pre-installed, uv can help manage interpreters during `uv run`/`uv sync`; otherwise install Python from python.org or use system package managers, then proceed with uv steps.[4][1]
- If activation fails in PowerShell due to script execution policy, change the policy for the current user as noted above and retry activation.[6][5]
